StoryArchive is a story/fanfiction website that I have been making (trying) over the past year now. 

It started when I got annoyed at [FanFiction.net’s](https://www.fanfiction.net/) and [ArchiveOfOurOwn’s](https://archiveofourown.org/) theme (among other things). [Wattpad’s](https://www.wattpad.com/) theme is quite nice but I don’t use it all too much due to story shortage, at least for the ones I’m looking for.

The next few posts will be about my experiences and thoughts on the different languages and frameworks I used and thought about using.

When I first started working on StoryArchive I immediately said no to PHP. 
‘Why?’, the small amount I have seen of it was a total mess and had the most backwards system ever, so I stuck with the language I knew. Java!

The only framework that I knew at the time was [Spark](http://sparkjava.com/) by [Per Wendel](https://github.com/perwendel/).

It is a very simple framework that was made for web data and not web pages, so while I got the base of the site running in a week something just didn’t feel right using it.

In general I really didn't have a problem using it but it was never made for the type of site I was trying to make. Even Spark's using know this as thats what mostof them use it of. They really need to run another survey than [the 2015 one](http://sparkjava.com/news#spark-survey-results).

I still use Spark for some project though like a game server manager allowing him to watch over the servers without needing to access the computer they are running on.
