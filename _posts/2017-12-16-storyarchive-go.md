StoryArchive is a story/fanfiction website that I have been making (trying) over the past year now. 

It started when I got annoyed at [FanFiction.net’s](https://www.fanfiction.net/) and [ArchiveOfOurOwn’s](https://archiveofourown.org/) theme (among other things). [Wattpad’s](https://www.wattpad.com/) theme is quite nice but I don’t use it all too much due to story shortage, at least for the ones I’m looking for.

The next few posts will be about my experiences and thoughts on the different languages and frameworks I used and thought about using.

[Go](https://golang.org/) is a language made by Google for the web. When I first heard of it I waved it off as I was learning Rust at the time and though of it like another C language.

I actually have no experience with Go itself as when I tried to use it nothing would build or run.

Some of the project I use, use Go, [GitBucket](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket) is a good example. Its Github but written in Go and can be installed to your laptop if you wanted.

Some developers even managed to get [ten million websocket connections](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/million-websockets-and-go-cc58418460bb) to communicate with each other. Elixir, another wen focused language, can only handle [two million connections](http://phoenixframework.org/blog/the-road-to-2-million-websocket-connections).

So, its not a weak language and looks a bit like Rust so I might try my hand at Go at some point maybe making something in it.
