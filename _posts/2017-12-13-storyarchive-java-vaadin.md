StoryArchive is a story/fanfiction website that I have been making (trying) over the past year now. 

It started when I got annoyed at [FanFiction.net’s](https://www.fanfiction.net/) and [ArchiveOfOurOwn’s](https://archiveofourown.org/) theme (among other things). [Wattpad’s](https://www.wattpad.com/) theme is quite nice but I don’t use it all too much due to story shortage, at least for the ones I’m looking for.

The next few posts will be about my experiences and thoughts on the different languages and frameworks I used and thought about using.

Although Vaadin gives me the ability to use only one language, to do so needs the actual CSS and JS file so it’s a bit counter intuitive.

I did try to remake the StoryArchive Hub page, or the homepage, in Vaadin but it didn’t really work out too well, and I never got past that. Not sure if it was the framework, the docs, or me not thinking, it just never made sense to me.

At some point I would like to go back and try Vaadin again but have never really had a chance or the need to yet, defent
