StoryArchive is a story/fanfiction website that I have been making (trying) over the past year now. 

It started when I got annoyed at [FanFiction.net’s](https://www.fanfiction.net/) and [ArchiveOfOurOwn’s](https://archiveofourown.org/) theme (among other things). [Wattpad’s](https://www.wattpad.com/) theme is quite nice but I don’t use it all too much due to story shortage, at least for the ones I’m looking for.

The next few posts will be about my experiences and thoughts on the different languages and frameworks I used and thought about using.

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a language that’s mostly used for tiny scripts you do for fun on the weekend and tools you need to make quickly. Apparently its also used to run massive website with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). [Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-Python-web-app-framework-and-why) can explain better than I can.

Now this version of StoryArchive was never going to be complete in the first place. It was made in responce to the fact that I just started college and one of my classes was Python.

I though hey perfect chance to try and learn it. I got the pages done but that was about it.

Small issue with Django’s router aside and that’s all I did with it.

I found Django to be quite fun but kind of strict on how the file structure is laid out. With every part of the website as a ‘module’ for Django to load.

Also their unaffable logo is a unicorn so that is something going for them at least.
